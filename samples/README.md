# /samples

This folder is intended for **end-to-end sample configurations** and reference implementations.

Current canonical sources in this repo:
- Platform CRDs: `k8s/crds/`
- Sample game repo: `examples/booklet-bindery-sample/`
- Module templates / reference module code: `modules/`

Notes:
- Keep samples minimal and runnable; avoid drifting from the standards in `docs/standards/`.
